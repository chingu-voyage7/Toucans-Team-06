## Introduction
Welcome Ladies and Gentelmen to our learning project for the Chingu Cohort Voyage 7. For this Voyage we have decided to put our coding skills to the test by building a full-stack app from one of the Tier-3 Projects. The lucky project that we agreed to takle for this Voyage was is the Wanderful-Travel app.

Wanderful-travel is a random travel destination web application where users are able to click on a button and be directed to a destination details page for the randomly generated location from the database.  While on the site users can view a brief description of the location and details such as hotels, restaurants, and entertainment available at the location. Additionally, users can get flight information to the destination's nearest airport.  After viewing their destinations users will have the opportunity to create an account which allow them to save and favorite the destinations for later retrieval on their dashboard.
