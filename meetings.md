## 29 Nov 18, Thursday
Today was our second team meeting and we had to make some minor changes to our workflow due to one missing team member. 

### Changes Made:
1. Switched project Tiers:
  * Moved from Tier-3 to Tier-2
  * Remaind team members felt that doing a Tier-3 project would be to much to handle for two indivudals. 
  * Still wanted to do a full-stack app
2. Full-stack app changed
  * Scrapped the Wanderful-Travel app
  * Picked up the Codemeets app instead
  
### Assigned Tasks
* Locate various code meetups in both Rhode Island and Florida
* Pick three to four meetups to be added to the project
* Create templates for adding assigned meetups
* Create folders and branches for each location
* Learn more about how to use React
